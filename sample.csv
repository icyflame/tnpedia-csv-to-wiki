",Some extra academic involvements  in sports/cultural/fest management help in showing one's interests apart from academics and also one's time managing skills.,"There was a test initially, which was solely based on core questions of the profile I had applied to. There were 7 other such profiles. ","A strong Bachelor's/Master's Project is very helpful, particularly if it is in the field they are recruiting us for. Same goes for internships. ","If one has an internship in a core company (in my case General Electric), it acts like a plus point. I was asked about my work experience in GE during my HR round. Since, it was also in Bangalore, they asked me about how I liked it staying and working in Bangalore.","There are few companies in core areas that doesn't take dual degree students. Airbus is a company that prefers Duals/Mtechs.

The problem is that the tests designed by companies for selecting students are not perfect and often stop some very very bright students also. This happens with so many people.
